# Turtle Crossing Game

This is a Turtle Crossing game implemented using the `turtle` module in Python. The game involves a player (turtle) that moves up the screen to cross a busy road filled with moving cars. The objective is to reach the finish line at the top of the screen without colliding with the cars.

## Features

- Randomly generated cars of different colors
- Increasing difficulty with levels
- Scoreboard to keep track of the player's level
- Simple keyboard controls

## Installation

To run this game, you'll need to have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

You also need to have the `turtle` module, which is included in the Python Standard Library.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `main.py` file to start the game.
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
4. Use the `Up` arrow key to move the player turtle up the screen.
5. Avoid the cars as you move towards the finish line at the top of the screen.
6. If you reach the finish line, you will advance to the next level, and the car speed will increase.
7. The game ends if your turtle collides with a car.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The entry point of the game. It initializes the game screen, creates instances of the player, car manager, and scoreboard, and contains the main game loop.
- `player.py`: Contains the `Player` class that handles the player turtle's movement and checks if it has reached the finish line.
- `car_manager.py`: Contains the `CarManager` class that handles the creation and movement of cars.
- `scoreboard.py`: Contains the `Scoreboard` class that displays the current level and shows the game over message.

## Classes

### Player

- `__init__()`: Initializes the player turtle at the starting position and sets its heading.
- `go_up()`: Moves the player turtle up the screen.
- `go_to_start()`: Resets the player turtle to the starting position.
- `is_at_finish_line()`: Checks if the player turtle has reached the finish line.

### CarManager

- `__init__()`: Initializes the car manager with an empty list of cars and sets the initial car speed.
- `create_car()`: Randomly creates a new car and adds it to the list of cars.
- `move_cars()`: Moves all the cars in the list.
- `level_up()`: Increases the car speed.

### Scoreboard

- `__init__()`: Initializes the scoreboard at the top left of the screen.
- `update_scoreboard()`: Clears the previous level display and writes the current level.
- `increase_level()`: Increases the level by 1 and updates the scoreboard.
- `game_over()`: Displays the game over message at the center of the screen.
